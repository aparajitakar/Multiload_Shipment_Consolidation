# Multiload Shipment Consolidation 

The objective of this study is to:
-> Identify delivery zones for multi-stop Truck load shipments
-> Provide shipping orders consolidation recommendations for multi-stop TL shipments
-> Compare the costs of consolidated TL shipments to the traditional Less Than Load mode of transportation. 

The aim is to understand if the logistic department at Daikin can reduce the costs of shipments through the multi-stop TL transportation model. Built a regression model to predict the cost of shipments through these Truckload and Less Than Truckload modes. Use clustering algorithms to determine the optimal zones of delivery. Provide a list of recommendations of these consolidated orders of shipments. 

Daikin can then decide which consolidation options of Truck Load shipments they would use given the recommendations to achieve the goal of minimizing costs.
